# OpenTelemetry Workshop for StrangeLoop 2021

Hello and welcome to the OpenTelemetry Workshop! Here you will learn how to:

- Automatically instrumenting an application written in Go, Java, Node, or Python.
- Send span data to an APM tool like Jaeger.
- Processing data including CRUD metadata operations via the OpenTelemetry
  Collector.
- Collecting host metrics and sending the data to a metrics tool like
  Prometheus.
- Ensure your telemetry data adheres to open-standards and remains
  vendor-agnostic.

## Prerequisites

- Docker with `docker-compose`

Optionally, it would be good to review [OpenTelemetry
concepts](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/).

## Getting Started

```
$ cd docker
$ docker-compose up --build
```

- Go is listening outside docker on `7070`.
- Java is listening outside docker on `8080`.
- Node is listening outside docker on `3000`.
- Python is listening outside docker on `5000`.

Exercise the API:

```
$ curl -i localhost:3000/hello
$ curl -i localhost:8080/hello/proxy/python/node/java
```

Other included components:

- Once instrumented with OpenTelemetry, view traces in Jaeger:
http://localhost:16686.
- An OpenTelemetry Collector is available and can receive data via:
  - Jaeger inside docker on `14250` and `14268`
  - OTLP inside docker on `4317` and `4318`
  - Zipkin inside/outside docker on `9411`
- A Prometheus server which receives OpenTelemetry Collector metrics is available at http://localhost:9090.
